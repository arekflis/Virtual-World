# Virtual-World

This was developed for my Object-Oriented Programming course. It is a game where the player can move across on the board and interact with animals and plants. Animals and plants can also impact on the situation on the board. The main goal of this project was to learn basic Object-Oriented Programming concepts, such as abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.
